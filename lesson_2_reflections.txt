What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    It creates a hidden .git folder to store commits and all the data they
    produce. You need to init a repository because if you don't it's just
    a standard directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    It's different in that it's a temporary location for files to be held before
    they are committed to the repo. This offers you the chance to review (and
    change your mind) about any files you've added to the staging area before
    committing them to the repo.
