When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When you're working on a project in collaboration with one or more other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because you may not be ready for the world to see something you're working on (for
    a number of reasons), especially if, as in most cases, it will take several commits
    to complete.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
instead of another?

    'Forks' are essentially GitHub's version of a clone. When you 'fork' a repo from
    another GitHub user you make a clone of it on your profile. When you clone a repo
    (whether from GitHub or a local repo) you're doing so on your local machine.
    Branches are separate arms (branches) within a repo.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored
locally?

    It allows you to log commits on your local machine without internet access, all
    while using the most recent version of the remote.
