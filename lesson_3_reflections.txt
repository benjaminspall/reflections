When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When you're working on a project in collaboration with one or more other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because you may not be ready for the world to see something you're working on (for
    a number of reasons), especially if, as in most cases, it will take several commits
    to complete.
